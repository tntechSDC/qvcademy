# qvcademy
This is a public repo for the qvcademy website designed by Quinn Morrison, Vincent Pestilli, and Cydney Miller for the benefit of all students and people trying to learn to program.

This project aims to adress the need for learning languages quickly in order to streamline the barrier for entry, working with projects in languages unfamiliar to programmers who already understand the basics of programming such as variables, loops, functions, comparison operators, and even some data structures like linked lists.

This project is NOT another website trying to teach the basics of programming, it's sole use is for those trying to quickly learn another langauge from the one they were originally taught or are most comfortable with. Imagine this program as a SparkNotes type of learning, where the summary of well written coding docs can be found and then applied to coding challenges to reinforce and familiarize language specific syntax.

Currently, this program is in development and has been since Nov 1st 2024. Our expected completion date is sometime in 2025, whether the spring or winter is unclear still as the scope of the project is still being realized.

Problems:

1. Fizzbuzz
Write a program that receives an integer as input. For every integer (i) up until this number is reached(Including that number):
- Output "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3
- Output "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5
- Output "FizzBuzz" if i is disivible by both 3 and 5
- Else, output i
Put newlines between each output

2. Two Sum
Take an integer for array size, a series of integers to be put into an array, and a sum integer as inputs.
Write a program that searches the array for values that add together to equal the provided sum. 
Output each pair of numbers as one string, with a newline separating different pairs.
