# LearningLanguagesWebsite
This is a public repo for the qvcademy website designed by Quinn Morrison, Vincent Pestilli, Cydney Miller for the benefit of all students and people trying to learn to program.

This project aims to adress the need for learning languages quickly in order to streamline the barrier for entry working with projects unfamiliar to programmers who already understand the basics of programming such as variables, loops, functions, comparison operators, and even some data structures like linked lists and hash tables.

This project is NOT another website trying to teach the basics of programming, it's sole use is for those trying to quickly learn another langauge from the one they were originally taught or are most comfortable with. Imagine this program as a SparkNotes type of learning, where the summary of well written coding docs can be found and then applied to coding challenges to reinforce and familiarize language specific syntax.

Currently, this program is in development and has been since Nov 1st 2024. Our expected completion date is sometime in 2025, whether the spring or winter is unclear still as the scope of the project is still being realized.
